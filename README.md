# Advent of Code 2025 🎄

My solutions to [AOC 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) in Python.

The project is managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).
You will also need [just](https://github.com/casey/just) for running commands.

To start a new day:

```bash
just good-morning
```

To run the solutions for a particular day (e.g., day 1):

```bash
just run 01
```

<!--To run all the solutions:

```bash
uv run merry_christmas.py
```-->
